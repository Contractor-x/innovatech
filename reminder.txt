i have deleted some RLS make sure to turn it back on

propewr way to handle RLS
The most sustainable, scalable, and best practice approach to handle Row Level Security (RLS) in Supabase is to implement proper RLS policies instead of disabling RLS entirely. Disabling RLS removes all security controls, which is not recommended for production environments as it can lead to unauthorized data access.

Recommended Best Practice: Create RLS Policies
For an admin interface registering teachers, you should create policies that allow inserts for authenticated admin users. Here's the SQL script to create proper RLS policies:


-- Enable RLS on all tables (if not already enabled)
ALTER TABLE Teachers ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE qualifications ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE work_experience ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE school_employment ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE emergency_contact ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policies that allow inserts for authenticated users
-- (Adjust the role check based on your authentication setup)

-- Teachers table
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to insert teachers" ON Teachers
FOR INSERT TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (true);

-- Qualifications table
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to insert qualifications" ON qualifications
FOR INSERT TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (true);

-- Work experience table
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to insert work experience" ON work_experience
FOR INSERT TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (true);

-- School employment table
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to insert school employment" ON school_employment
FOR INSERT TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (true);

-- Emergency contact table
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to insert emergency contact" ON emergency_contact
FOR INSERT TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (true);
Alternative: Use Service Role Key
If you prefer not to manage RLS policies, you can modify the client-side code to use the service role key instead of the anon key for admin operations. The service role key bypasses RLS entirely and should only be used server-side or for trusted admin operations.

To get the service role key:

Go to Supabase Dashboard > Settings > API
Copy the "service_role" key (keep it secret!)
Then update your code to use the service role key for admin operations:


const SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY = "your_service_role_key_here";
const supabaseAdmin = supabase.createClient(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY);
However, exposing the service role key client-side is a security risk and not recommended for production. The best practice is to handle admin operations server-side.

Which to Choose?
RLS Policies (Recommended): Most secure and scalable. Allows fine-grained control over data access.
Service Role Key (Server-side): Secure but requires backend implementation.
Disable RLS (Not Recommended): Quick fix but removes all security.
For your current setup, I'd recommend starting with the RLS policies approach. Run the SQL script above in your Supabase SQL Editor, then test the teacher registration again.
